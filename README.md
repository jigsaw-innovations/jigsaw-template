This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Prequesites

- node
- ruby (if deploying from your local) (apple version ruby 2.6.10p210)
- fastlane (if deploying from your local)


Android Developement:

* Android studio
* Java JDK


export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Getting Started



## Using yarn


## Using npm


## Setup environment variables

Create `.env`, `.env-production`

...


For jigsaw cli:

When user runs: $ jigsaw new <app_name>

1. Curl jigsaw template repo (without android and ios directories)
2. Replace __template__ with <app_name>
3. npm i react-native-eject
4. react-native eject (generating ios and android directories)
5. cd ios/ && pod install

...

Prompt user if they want to include Firebase authentication [y/N]:

If no, remove Firebase auth files (GoogleButton.tsx and AppleButton.tsx)
If yes, take user through Firebase setup

Prompt user for .env , .env-staging, .env-production form



## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
